                                    Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and
                                    they represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the
                                    coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand.

                                    men in an uneasy alliance
                                    against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.
                                    In 1862, during the American Civil War, a mercenary known as "Angel Eyes"
                                    interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted
                                    to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of Confederate gold.
                                    Learning Jackson's new alias "Bill Carson", Angel Eyes kills Stevens and then
                                    his employer Baker so he can find the gold himself. Bandit Tuco Ramirez is
                                    rescued from bounty hunters by a nameless drifter to whom Tuco refers as
                                    "Blondie", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty.
                                    As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and
                                    sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty. They repeat the
                                    process in other towns until Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and
                                    strands him in the desert.
